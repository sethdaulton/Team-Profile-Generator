# Team Profile Generator

## Description

For this challenge assignment, I was tasked with creating a generator that can be used to create a team profile. The generator is run with javascript and collects information from the command line and puts it into an html file. The html file is styled to look professional with CSS. The generated team has contact information and employee information for each team member. The command line prompts ask you if you want to add more team members once you create a team manager. You also have the option to finish the generation once you add an engineer or intern.
